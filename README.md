# RDBMS

Relational database management system (RDBMS) is the most common database management system. In this project, I will use Python to design a RDBMS from scratch according to the project guideline. The system will implement all the features mentioned in the project guideline and have a new language that is different from the existing database languages. Through this project, I have deepened my understanding of this course and improved my ability to solve problems through programming.

## Files Description

### Code
- database.py: defines a Database class, which implements creating / dropping tables, and inserting / deleting / updating / querying records, etc.
- engine.py: defines an Engine class, which implements creating / dropping databases and interaction with users, etc.
- main.py: the entrance of the program.

### Data
- databases/: The folder where all databases in this RDBMS are stored.
- databases/iris/: The folder where the iris database is stored (in order to demonstrate the query function more conveniently, I divided the original iris data set into two tables and stored them in the database in advance).
- databases/iris/metadata.jsonl: The .jsonl file that stores metadata for the iris database.
- databases/iris/Attribute.jsonl: The .jsonl file that stores the Attribute table of the iris database.
- databases/iris/Kind.jsonl: The .jsonl file that stores the Kind table of the iris database.

## Running Environment
This RDBMS can run in the following environment (due to time constraints, I have not tested whether it can run normally in other software and hardware environments. If you cannot run it normally, please contact me at sunchenn@usc.edu and I will do my best to help you :)).

### Hardware
- computer: MacBook Pro 14-inch, 2021
- cpu: Apple M1 Pro
- memory: 16 GB (Although I don't think it needs to consume a lot of memory to run this RDBMS)

### Software
- Python 3.9.6
- dependent libraries (These are the standard libraries of Python 3.9.6. If you donâ€™t have them, you need to install them using pip3)
-- json
-- typing
-- os
-- shutil
-- functools
-- tempfile

## Usage Examples
I will show you how to use this RDBMS in the form of menu interaction through three examples (see the report for screenshots of these three examples).

### Start
First, you need to enter the terminal and set the current path to RDBMS (if your current path is already RDBMS, you do not need to perform this step):
```
cd <path-to-RDBMS>
```

Next, you need to start the program:
```
python3 main.py
```

Then, you can complete the following tasks through the interactive menu (for ease of use, the menu has given a large number of hints, you only need to enter the relevant instructions according to the hints):

### Example 1
query: find iris samples that belong to Iris-versicolor, return ids only in descending order (using select, project, sort).
